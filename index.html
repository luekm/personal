                <h3>Project 1: ASCII Terminal Game </h3>
                <p>This project was written entirely in C++, and was a final project for Com S 327. It was designed
                    with inspiration from retro arcade games. It features a high-score tracker, and time based difficulty system.
                The enemies use a simple pathfinding algorithm to chase the player character in which the player 
                 can shoot back at them, and the goal is to survive as long as possible.    </p>
